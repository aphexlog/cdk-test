    "description": "JavaScript Lambda function triggered by an argument input of an IP address from an SNS Topic. Once the function is triggered it will perform a match lookup against the following [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets/master/bi_sip_0_1d.ipset). If match resolves `true` then an S3 bucket with the name of the IP address will be created, along with one object per attempt to connect. Each object will be named with a timestamp of the attempt with geolocational metadata written to it.",
